In this section we illustrate the possibilities of our description
language.  The first system studied is a distributed database system.
Then we describe a load balancing system which makes use of more
advanced features of our tool.  The third example is the well-known
puzzle of the towers of Hanoi.  This one illustrates a use of
high-level data types provided by Helena.
